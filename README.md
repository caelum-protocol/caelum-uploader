# Caelum Memory Vault

**Caelum Memory Vault** is a futuristic memory archiver built with Next.js. Users can upload files that are stored locally and grouped into unique "shards." The interface supports multiple animated themes (Matrix rain, Iris nebula, and Pepe mode), transitions, sound effects, and toast notifications. Data persists via `localStorage`, enabling full offline usage.

## Features

- âš¡ **Clientâ€‘side only** â€“ works completely offline
- ðŸŽ¨ **Dynamic themes** â€“ dark, Matrix, Iris, and Pepe with animated effects
- ðŸª„ **Smooth transitions** powered by Framer Motion
- ðŸ”Š **Sound effects** and toastâ€‘based UI feedback
- ðŸ“‚ **Shard system** to group and download memories
- ðŸ’¾ **LocalStorage persistence** across sessions

### Package for Windows

You can export a static build and wrap it with a tool such as Tauri or Electron to produce a `.exe` file:

```bash
npm run build
npx next export
# then package the `out` folder with your preferred wrapper
```

### Android (optional)

The app works as a Progressive Web App. Install it from the browser or wrap the exported build in tools like Capacitor to generate an Android package.
